secondsuitor: make a basic blog with flask and django

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can help you with that. Which framework would you like to use, Flask or Django?

secondsuitor: flask

GitHub Copilot: Great! Here's a plan for building a basic blog with Flask:

1. Set up a virtual environment for your project.
2. Install Flask using pip.
3. Create a Flask application instance.
4. Define routes for your blog pages.
5. Create templates for your blog pages using Jinja2.
6. Set up a database to store your blog posts.
7. Create a form to add new blog posts.
8. Add functionality to submit new blog posts to the database.
9. Display blog posts on the home page.
10. Add functionality to view individual blog posts.

Here's some sample code to get you started:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///blog.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    posts = Post.query.all()
    return render_template('home.html', posts=posts)

@app.route('/post/<int:id>')
def post(id):
    post = Post.query.get_or_404(id)
    return render_template('post.html', post=post)

@app.route('/new_post', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def new_post():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        title = request.form['title']
        content = request.form['content']
        post = Post(title=title, content=content)
        db.session.add(post)
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect('/')
    return render_template('new_post.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask application instance and sets up a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy. It also defines routes for the home page, individual blog posts, and a form to add new blog posts. The templates for these pages are not included, but you can create them using Jinja2.

secondsuitor: make a wsgi app

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example of a simple WSGI app:

```python
def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain')]
    start_response(status, headers)
    return [b'Hello, world!']
```

This app defines a function called `application` that takes two arguments: `environ` and `start_response`. `environ` is a dictionary containing information about the request, such as the HTTP method, headers, and query parameters. `start_response` is a function that takes two arguments: the HTTP status code and a list of headers.

The function returns a list of bytes representing the response body. In this case, it simply returns the string "Hello, world!" encoded as bytes.

To run this app, you can use a WSGI server such as uWSGI or Gunicorn. Here's an example of how to run the app using uWSGI:

```
uwsgi --http :8000 --wsgi-file app.py
```

This command starts a uWSGI server listening on port 8000 and runs the `application` function defined in `app.py`. You can then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to see the "Hello, world!" message.

secondsuitor: add folders to .gitignore

GitHub Copilot: Sure, to add folders to your `.gitignore` file, you can simply add the folder names to the file, one per line. Here's an example:

```
myenv/
node_modules/
dist/
```

In this example, the `myenv/`, `node_modules/`, and `dist/` folders are added to the `.gitignore` file. This means that any files in these folders will be ignored by Git and will not be included in your repository.

Note that you can also use wildcards to ignore multiple files or folders with similar names. For example, to ignore all `.pyc` files in a folder, you can add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

```
*.pyc
```

This will ignore all files with the `.pyc` extension in the current folder and its subfolders.
