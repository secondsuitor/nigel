Personal blog that will have a growing scope

This is being built based on:
1.  An intoruction to Flask in a 1/3 to 2/3 run through of Miguel Grinberg's tutorial: https://courses.miguelgrinberg.com/p/flask-mega-tutorial
2.  Trying to use co-pilot

The overall intents are:
1.  Learn the matrial obviously
2.  Explore co-pilot
3.  Form a tutorial / base for anyone it might benefit

As development proceeds, this will enventually eb deployed where the chat log and the like will then be made available, but all in a more narrative format. I'm thinking like a very bootstrappy thing. I'll be documenting the process for building the tools I want for my docuemntation.
